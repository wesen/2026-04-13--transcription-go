## Use from Claude Code

This repo ships a Claude Code plugin called **`nemotron-customize`** that turns the step catalog 
under [`src/nemotron/steps/`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Nemotron/blob/main/src/nemotron/steps) 
into a guided, repo-native pipeline builder.

Install once:

```
/plugin marketplace add NVIDIA/Nemotron
/plugin install nemotron-customize@nvidia-nemotron
```

Then, **start Claude Code from the repo root** and invoke the skill:

```
cd /path/to/Nemotron        # repo root: must contain pyproject.toml and src/nemotron/steps/
claude
```

```
/nemotron-customize
```

The skill resolves all file paths against your current working directory, so it must be invoked 
from the Nemotron checkout root. Running it from a subdirectory will cause file reads to fail.

The skill plans the step DAG, validates artifact wiring, and emits the YAML configs needed to run 
the requested pipeline. See 
[`skills/nemotron-customize/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Nemotron/blob/main/skills/nemo
tron-customize/SKILL.md) for the full contract.

> The marketplace installs **only** `nemotron-customize`. The other folders under 
[`skills/`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Nemotron/blob/main/skills) (model knowledge bases, 
contributor add- `*` skills) stay on disk for repo browsing but are not loaded as plugins.

## What is Nemotron?

[NVIDIA Nemotron](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/nemotron/) is a 
family of open, high-efficiency multimodal models purpose-built for agentic AI.

**Model Tiers:**

- **Nano** — Optimized for edge and PC deployments
- **Super** — Single GPU deployment with highest throughput
- **Ultra** — Multi-GPU datacenter applications

Nemotron models excel at coding, math, scientific reasoning, tool calling, instruction following, 
and visual reasoning. Deploy across edge, single GPU, or data center environments with support for 
NeMo, TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang, and NIM microservices.

---

## Nemotron Steps

A *Nemotron step* is a named, reusable unit of work that you invoke with the `nemotron steps` CLI. 
Each step packages a description of the work it performs, the artifacts it consumes and produces, 
and one or more named configurations that supply parameter values. Steps live under 
[`src/nemotron/steps/`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Nemotron/blob/main/src/nemotron/steps), and 
the CLI discovers them at startup.

The training recipes in the next section are composed from these steps. Run a step on its own when 
you want one stage, or chain steps together when you need a different pipeline shape than the 
published recipes.

### Step Categories

The catalog covers the full training lifecycle.

- Data curation and preparation with `curate/*` and `data_prep/*`.
- Synthetic data generation (SDG) with `sdg/*`.
- Corpus translation with `translate/*`.
- Bring-your-own benchmark generation with `byob/*`.
- Pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and 
reinforcement learning (RL) with `pretrain/*`, `sft/*`, `peft/*`, and `rl/*`.
- Checkpoint conversion and model optimization with `convert/*` and `optimize/*`.
- Benchmark evaluation with `eval/*`.
- Execution-profile setup with `env/*`.

### Documentation

- [About Nemotron Steps](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Nemotron/blob/main/docs/steps/index.md) is 
the entry point for the step model.
- [Nemotron Steps Basics](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Nemotron/blob/main/docs/steps/basics.md) 
defines *step*, *configuration*, *environment profile*, and *artifact*.
- [Getting Started With 
Steps](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Nemotron/blob/main/docs/steps/getting-started.md) walks 
through the CLI on a small example.

## Training Recipes

The Nemotron repository provides reproducible training pipelines from raw data to deployment-ready 
models. These implementations reflect how large language models are actually trained: careful 
experimentation, validation gates, and systematic optimization.

### Why Complete Pipelines?

Training a production model involves interconnected components. Isolated examples miss how stages 
interact. Complete pipelines show:

- **How data quality affects downstream performance** across pretraining, SFT, and RL
- **Which training techniques actually work together**, not just in theory
- **Where validation gates prevent failures** and maintain reproducibility
- **How to balance competing objectives** across stages

Because these are complete systems, you can extract specific techniques with confidence. Each 
component has been proven to work in context.

### Each Recipe Includes

- 🎨 **Synthetic Data Generation** - Scripts to generate synthetic datasets using 
[NVIDIA-NeMo/DataDesigner](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/DataDesigner)
- 🗂️ **Data Curation** - Scripts to prepare training data using [NVIDIA NeMo 
Curator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator) for scalable data processing, filtering, and 
quality enhancement
- 🔁 **Training** - Complete training loops with hyperparameters using:
	- [NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge/tree/main) 
for Megatron models
		- [NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel) for HuggingFace 
models
		- [NVIDIA-NeMo/NeMo-RL](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/tree/main) when RL is 
needed
		- Includes GPU-accelerated last-mile data processing (tokenization + optional 
sequence packing) for optimal training efficiency
- 📊 **Evaluation** - Benchmark evaluation on standard suites using [NVIDIA NeMo 
Evaluator](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Evaluator)
- 📖 **Documentation** - Detailed explanations of each stage
